                        <p>I am a software engineer that has skills in both the back-end of web applications and the front-end. My previous career as a designer brought me close to my true passion: building web applications. I wasnâ€™t satisfied with only being involved in the visual aspect, and wanted a deeper involvement in building out applications. In the next phase of my career, I not only want to use my design skills to make the application look beautiful, but I also want to work on the technically challenging facets of the application too. At my ideal company, I would work on a small team (5-8 people) that follows best practices like Test Driven Development and pair programming to help me learn and grow as a developer.</p>
